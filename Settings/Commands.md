NoCheatPlus integrates a lightweight command system. It allows you to quickly exempt players from checks or to access and manage check data about a player. 

All commands support tab completion and some even allow shortcuts. The root command is named **nocheatplus**, however the alias **ncp** should also work and is used for reference here.

NoCheatPlus also supports [Bukkit aliases](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Bukkit.yml#aliases) if you wish to have another alias command aside form **nocheatplus** and **ncp**.

You can give a player access to a specific command by giving them the sub-node with the commands default name, like `nocheatplus.admin.info`.
For further information about permissions in NoCheatPlus, we recommend looking at the [Permissions](https://github.com/MyPictures/NoCheatPlus/wiki/Permissions#commands).

# Administrative commands
Those commands are used to basically manage NoCheatPlus on your server. Arguments in **( )** are needed, while arguments in **[ ]** are optional.

| Command                 | Explanation |
| :---------------------- | :---------- |
| /ncp reload | Reloads, generates and regenerates the configuration file of NoCheatPlus. Run this in-case you changed something on your configuration file while your server was running. |
| /ncp notify on/off | Toggle all in-game notifications/alerts generated by NoCheatPlus. |
| /ncp info (player) | Display the violation levels of a given player. |
| /ncp lag | Show info about server sided latency. The average lag shows the percentage of the server running too slow (0% = 20 tps, 10% = 18 tps) for the last 1 second, 3.33 and 270 seconds, roughly. Also lag spikes are displayed, tracked over at most 1 hour with a resolution of 20 minutes buckets (i.e. not exact) for spikes > 150 ms (3x to 20x) and spikes > 1000 ms (20x +). Be aware that this information is needed to make most NoCheatPlus checks adapt to server sided lag. |
| /ncp removeplayer (player) [check_type] | Remove all the data collected by NoCheatPlus so far for a given player. You can use the [check_type] option to make NoCheatPlus only remove data from a specific check (Default will clean all data of all checks!). To list all check names execute a command such as this: /ncp removeplayer (PlayerName) list. "*" is supported here. |
| /ncp exempt (player) [check_type] | Exempt a player from being checked by NoCheatPlus or by a specific check. |
| /ncp unexempt (player) [check_type] | Remove any exemption you given to a specified player. "*" Is supported here. |
| /ncp exemptions (player) | Gives back a list of all check that a specific player has been exempted from. |
| /ncp commands | List all commands, more than shown here. The other commands are mainly for use with actions, such as delaying other commands, kicking with a message, telling players messages in colour, deny login for a players, allow it again and other. |
| /ncp top [num_entries] _(check type/s)_ [sort order] | Show the 'top' players by violation history. Default sort order is '-n -sumvl' . Sort priority can be specified using -n for number of violations, -sumvl for the sum of all added vl, -avgvl for the average added vl, -maxvl for the maximum of all added vl and -time for sorting by the last violation time. |
| /ncp version | Show version information about the server, plugin, compatibility modules and registered hooks. |
| /ncp log counters| Log special statistics. |

# Auxiliary commands
Those commands are mainly used by NoCheatPlus itself to execute strings or commands over actions on violating players but you can also make use of them if you wish to do so. Most of them have no difference compared to the vanilla commands apart from the delay option. Some might be confined to console use.
Arguments in **( )** are needed, while arguments in **[ ]** are optional.

| Command                 | Explanation |
| :---------------------- | :---------- |
| /ncp ban \[delay=(ticks)] (player) [reason] | Ban a player from your server (banned-players.txt). |
| /ncp kick \[delay=(ticks)] (player) [reason] | Kicks a player from your server. |
| /ncp unkick (player) | Allows you to remove a tempkick/tempban from a player. "*" is supported here. |
| /ncp kicklist | Lists all players that have been tempkicked/tempbanned on your server by NoCheatPlus actions. |
| /ncp tell \[delay=(ticks)] (player) (message) | Send a private message to a specified player, using color codes with '&'. |
| /ncp delay \[delay=(ticks)] (command) | Execute a command delayed by the given number of ticks. **Commands are executed with OP privileges (console).** |
| /ncp log stream (stream_id)\[@(level)]\[?color/?nocolor] (message) | Log to the logging stream system of NoCheatPlus. Shortcuts for stream_id are: notify (ingame notification), debug (debug to file), init (only for setup), status (runtime status/errors), console for the plugin logger, file for the default log file. Level for errors is @severe, @info is default, @fine for debugging. If no level is set the debug shortcut will use the level @fine. Default levels and numbers (Java) are supported. All registered stream ids (case sensitive) are supported. To force add colors append ?color (c, col) to the level definition, to force remove colors append ?nocolor (nc, noc, nocol). To log to multiple streams, each with individual level and color/nocolor-flag, separate definitions by '+'. Don't include spaces with definitions (e.g. _/ncp log stream notify?c+console@warning?nc &ctest&etest&ctest_). |

# stopwatch
Especially with measuring distances and/or time, these might be useful. The 'stopwatch' command allows abbreviation with 'sw', only for players. The precision of the distance-related variants is determined by on-tick execution of checking, so it may not be as precise in environments with larger lag/delay spikes (client or server). Typically a distance of 100 blocks straight without height difference is a good measure for comparison (1.11.2 and before about 14 seconds without effects). Speed cheats should be compared to continuous sprint+jump ("bunny-hopping"), unless it's a low-food-level comparison, because the sprinting state isn't always correctly reported on server side, so we assume sprinting whenever technically possible.

| Command                 | Explanation |
| :---------------------- | :---------- |
| /ncp stopwatch start | Simply start a stopwatch. The time for an already running stopwatch would be shown in chat. |
| /ncp stopwatch stop | Stop a running stopwatch and show time in chat. |
| /ncp stopwatch distance (distance) | Start a stopwatch, automatically stop when the player has reached the given distance (blocks). This is not 100% precise (on-tick), but it does use the euclidean distance. |
| /ncp stopwatch return (margin) | Simply start a stopwatch, automatically stop when the player returns to the position where the stopwatch had been started, with the given margin (blocks, euclidean, on-tick). |
