Strings is our elegant solution to prevent insanely long actions for every check. You can basically imagine it as redirection or alias kinda.

The template:
![StringsExplenation](Resources/StringsExplenation.gif)

For this to execute you would adjust your actions like this:  
cancel vl>1500 log:flylong:2:5:cif **cmd:baybay**
