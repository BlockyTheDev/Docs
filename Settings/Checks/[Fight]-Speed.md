Exemption: `FIGHT_SPEED`  

Minecraft doesn't restrict the amount of hits a player can do in each second so we made a check that will prevent a player from going over the allowed hit speed limit (more hits = more damage).

| Option              | Description |
| :------------------ | :---------- |
| limit               | How many hits should be allowed to do in each second? |
| shortterm _ticks_   | |
| shortterm _limit_   | |
