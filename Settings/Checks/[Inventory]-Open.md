In order to support Minecraft in preventing dupe bugs, we have come up with a simple idea to close inventories on teleports and other activities.

| Option              | Description |
| :------------------ | :---------- |
| close               | Set to true to close inventories if conflicting other actions. |
| cancelother         | Cancel other actions as well that conflict with an open inventory. |
