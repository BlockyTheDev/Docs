Config path: `checks.fight.selfhit`  
Permission (bypass): `nocheatplus.checks.fight.selfhit`  
Exemption: `FIGHT_SELFHIT`  

This check was designed to prevent hackers from hitting themselves, abusing that knockback effect and fly or do other illegal things. However Mojang fixed this exploit in Minecraft 1.4.5 and higher, so you can disable this without worries if you are on a up to date Minecraft version. 

**Notes**
* Leaving selfhit enabled wont conflict with Mojangs or Spigots fix on this exploit
