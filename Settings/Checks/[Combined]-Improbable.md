Config path: `checks.combined.improbable`  
Permission (bypass): `nocheatplus.checks.combined.improbable`  
Exemption: `COMBINED_IMPROBABLE`  

Check that is fed by multiple inputs within NoCheatPlus and other checks as well in order to catch everything that might slip past under the radar of the other checks, meant to (as the check suggests) catch improbable behaviour on a longer run. 

| Option             | Description |
| :--------------    | :---------- |
| level              | How lenient should Improbable be when checking players? Higher the value, the more the time this check will take to stop cheaters. |
