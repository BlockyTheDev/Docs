Exemption: `COMBINED_IMPROBABLE`  

Improbable is a simple heuristic check which combines several frequencies and occurrences from other checks/inputs into one count. It's rather meant to suggest that the player could be cheating by intercepting 'symptoms' of improbable behaviour in a longer run. (E.g.: turning around extremely quick does not mean that the player is cheating per se, but it is suspicious etc...) 

| Option             | Description |
| :--------------    | :---------- |
| level              | How lenient should Improbable be when checking players. Higher the value, the more the time this check will take to stop cheaters. |
