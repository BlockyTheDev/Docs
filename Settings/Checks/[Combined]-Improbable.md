Exemption: `COMBINED_IMPROBABLE`  

Improbable is a simple heuristic check which combines several frequencies and occurrences from other checks/inputs into one count. As the name would suggest, it's meant to catch improbable behaviour a longer run. (E.g.: turning around very quickly, hitting too quickly etc...) It's rather meant to suggest that the player could be cheating by intercepting 'symptoms'.

| Option             | Description |
| :--------------    | :---------- |
| level              | How lenient should Improbable be when checking players. Higher the value, the more the time this check will take to stop cheaters. |
