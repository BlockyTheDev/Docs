Config path: `checks.combined.bedleave`  
Permission (bypass): `nocheatplus.checks.combined.beadleave`  
Exemption: `COMBINED_BEDLEAVE`  

This check makes sure that there has been a bed near the player if they send a bed-leave packet. Without this check, players could abuse the small "teleport" you do after exiting a bed in order to fly around.
