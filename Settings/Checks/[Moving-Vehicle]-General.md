This page explains configuration options which affect vehicles.

| Option                          | Description |
| :------------------------------ | :---------- |
| vehicles _preventdestroyown_    | Prevent players to destroy their own cart while inside of it.|
| vehicles _enforcelocation_      | Attempt to track extreme deviations from the vehicle position and correct them. Experimental (hopefully-) legacy option. Likely inoperable and useless, subject to removal.|
| vehicle _schedulesetbacks_      | TODO: |
|vehicle _schedulesetpassenger_   | TODO: |
| illegalvehiclemove              | Kick and log this message to players who try to exploit vehicles.|

**Note**
* Minecraft fixed the "destroyown vehicle" bug so vehicles preventdestroyown option is just here for legacy servers. Leaving it enabled won't conflict with anything either.
