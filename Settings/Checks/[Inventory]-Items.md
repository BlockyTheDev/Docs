This check was a hotfix against a devastating exploit in Minecraft 1.4.5 (and lower) which allowed hackers to apply unlimited enchantments on a book without paying any exp or similar. So a book could kill players instantly or have loot X on it and drop 100 leather from a cow.

**Notes**
* In Minecraft 1.4.6 this exploit got fixed and the "enchanted books" got introduced into the game
