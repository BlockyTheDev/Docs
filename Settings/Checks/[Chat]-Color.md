Config path: `checks.chat.color`  
Permission (bypass): `nocheatplus.checks.chat.color`  
Exemption: `CHAT_COLOR`  

Color is an obsolete check that was designed to stop players from using color in their chat messages even tho they didn't have the permissions for color. Mojang fixed this long time ago but you can still use it if you run on a very old Minecraft version.
