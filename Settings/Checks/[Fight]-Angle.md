 Angle is a multi-algorithm check which prevents players from hitting too many entities at the same time (2 or more)

| Option              | Description |
| :------------------ | :---------- |
| threshold| Control the strictness of every checking method, if the VL generated by the algorithm is higher than its threshold, Angle will trigger.|
| threshold _average_move_         | Average move between each attacks, if the move is inferior to 0.2 blocks, a violation will be generated. | Average time between each attacks, if the time elapsed is inferior to 150ms, a violation will be generated.
| threshold average_time| Average time between each attacks, if the time elapsed is inferior to 150ms, a violation will be generated.
|threshold average_yaw| Average yaw change between each attacks, if the player's yaw is inferior to 50 degrees, a violation will be generated.
|threshold average_switch| Checks for too fast target switch (if greater than 0 it'll trigger a violation)
