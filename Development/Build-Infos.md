# Release types
| Release type | Explanation |
| :------------| :---------- |
| **RC release** | Official stable release. The developer is somewhat convinced, that we can't do much better within short term. |
| **release candidate** | Meant to become a RC release soon, waiting for last minute feedback. |
| **BETA Release** | Official beta release, possibly some areas remain uncovered, or it's not been time to test further. A _mostly stable_ development build might also be released as beta (marked as recommended on Jenkins). |
| **mostly stable** | A development build that has been tested a lot and appears to be good to use, or at least the best option for a specific Minecraft version. |
| development | Ordinary development builds. |
| [BLEEDING] | Bleeding edge development builds that contain changes, which need a lot of testing to consolidate, or which are of experimental nature, consequently running into issues with these can't be excluded. |

Broken builds usually are marked as _broken_ or _deficient_ or get removed from Jenkins. They should not appear in this list, unless to indicate that people should update.
